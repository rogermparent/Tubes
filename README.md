**The self-hosted website solution (Eventually, hopefully)**

Heya! This is a passion project created in hopes to solve the issues facing free speech on the internet. It's *incredibly* in development right now, I certainly wouldn't use it for anything in production in its current state- hopefully I can change that soon.

## Basics

This project is built with "off-the-shelf" open-source software- namely GatsbyJS and Netlify CMS as well as the plugins and dependencies they include. It aims to be an alternative to content delivery and social media sites like YouTube, Twitter, and Wordpress.

While it's build in React, I strongly hold the belief that most, if not all functionality should be accessible without JavaScript- on the user end, at least.

## Roadmap

 - [ ] Video Component
 - [ ] Blogging Component
 - [ ] Microblogging functionality
